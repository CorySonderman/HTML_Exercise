        During my journey through life I have: loved, lost, found and lost
        again. Professionally I have worn many hats, from a runway model and
        personal trainer to a top sales producer for every businees that I've
        partnered with. Currently, I'm a coder on the rise. I have 3 black belts
        (Shotokan, Jiu Jitsu, and Kyusho Jitsu), but my proudest accomplishment
        is undeniably my efforts to be the best dad I can be. My fears are many,
        but my biggest is failing as a father.

      <p>I'm an open book so what else would you like to know?</p>

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon </span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
